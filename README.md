# Madlibs in Elm

This is my entry for the July/August 2016 Solium programming competition.

Note that this is no way an ideal Elm program :)

The corpus of adjectives, nouns, and verbs comes from the [Wordnet database][1]

Parsing of inputs is done with the [Stanford CoreNLP project server][2].

## Building

Work in progress :)
